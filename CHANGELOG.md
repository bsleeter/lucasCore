# Changelog

Changes to lucasCore by version. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased (planned 1.1.0)

### Added
- Stage 16, Model Record: a Build's FGDC CSDGM record in its own stage.
- Stage 17, Data Release: writes a USGS data release folder from a Build and its runs, with content checks and a review packet.
- Release Information and People pages for data releases.
- A path to mp (the USGS metadata parser) on the Data Sources page.
- RCMAP can be supplied by hand when ScienceBase refuses a script.
- User Guide Appendix B: the USGS data release workflow, worked on Puget Lowlands.
- Repository files for a USGS software release: code.json, LICENSE.md, DISCLAIMER.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Stages 16 and 17 in the package blueprint; links between the guide and blueprints are relative.

### Changed
- Stage 16 names whoever runs it, from the scenario's Release Information page.
- Model records cite the copy of each dataset the Build read, and say when it came by hand.
- Stratum Sources page redrawn in the style of the Data Sources page.
- Tests and tools take their locations from the script's folder and environment variables instead of paths on the build machine.

### Fixed
- Data Release page: "What to write" was cut off.
- Data Release and Release Information pages: Add a run crashed SyncroSim Studio.
